# Hello! I'm Axel Padilla

A computer science student @ Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, and a Software Engineer at [Adok](adokmx.com). I have used a lot of Typescript (for both backend and frontend), and a lot of React. I am also experienced in using Next.js. For other languages, I also use Python regularly for simple scripts or some standalone backends. Finally, I use the ocasional C/C++, Matlab or Python for school.

Have a look at my [(unfinished) website](https://axelpadilla.me/)
